# SOS

A hobbyist's weaksauce attempt at making an operating system

Currently includes nothing reminiscent of anything useful that you would find
in any *real* OS

Feature set as of right now includes:

- printing text (limited)
- getting keyboard input (limited)
- manipulating vga console (limited)
