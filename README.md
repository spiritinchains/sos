# SOS

A hobbyist's weaksauce attempt at making an operating system

Currently includes nothing reminiscent of anything useful that you would find
in any *real* OS

## How to build

Simply run `make` from the project root directory.

Only runs on i386. Requires [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) to compile.

## To-do

- [X] getting keyboard input
- [X] manipulating vga console
- [X] serial input/output
- [X] paging and dynamic memory management
- [ ] process management
- [ ] filesystems
- [ ] proper user space/kernel space separation
- [ ] multitasking
- [ ] ~~doom port~~
